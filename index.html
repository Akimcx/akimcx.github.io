            14 in 2009, Abass Dev became fascinated with the world of web
            development. However, he had no idea where to start. It wasn't until
            he met a friend on Skyrock, a social networking site, in 2011, that
            he was introduced to the world of blogging and tasked with
            administering a Wix-created blog. It was this experience that
            sparked his curiosity and ignited his passion for web development.
            In 2012, Abass Dev created his own blog on the Blogspot platform,
            but soon discovered its limitations. Determined to expand his
            knowledge and capabilities, he began to explore the depths of web
            development using languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL,
            and others. With his dedication and hard work, Abass Dev honed his
            skills and became a self-taught full-stack developer. Today, he has

            <h4>GPTv1</h4>
            Hello, my name is [Name] and I am a network engineer and developer. My passion for technology started when I stumbled upon "Le blog du hacker," a website that introduced me to the world of programming and networking. It was like a 'd√©clic' moment for me, and I found myself diving deeper and deeper into this fascinating field.

Eventually, I discovered "OpenClassroom," a MOOC website that covers a broad range of topics, including programming, networking, and more. Starting with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I quickly progressed to more advanced topics like PHP and eventually Java programming. Learning Java was the best decision of my life, as I still use it extensively to this day. Additionally, I received my first introduction to Linux and networking through OpenClassroom.

After my time with OpenClassroom, I continued my education by studying networking at university. However, during my second year, the Covid-19 pandemic hit, which meant I had to adjust to learning online. Luckily, I had the opportunity to take the "CCNAv7 Introduction to Network" course at the Cisco Networking Academy and received a certificate. I also took courses on Linux and Python during this time.

Once the lockdown was lifted, I returned to university and finished my studies. Now, I am eager to practice and further develop my skills by finding a job that allows me to apply my knowledge of technologies like Ansible, Docker, and more. I am passionate about the intersection of networking and programming, and I am excited to see where this journey takes me.
