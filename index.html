          <p class="sub-title">Network Engineer - Developer</p>
          <p>
            Kassim A. Acacia who goes by the name of Akimcx or Akim, is a
            talented network engineer & developer. In his free time he enjoy
            experimenting with new technologies & building innovative software.
            His expertise in networking allows him to develop optimized
            solutions with a focus on connectivity and reliability, while his
            passion for coding drives him to stay up-to-date with the latest
            trends in software development.<br />
            His passion for technology started when he stumbled upon "Le blog du
            hacker", a website that introduced him to the world of programming
            and networking. It was like a 'd√©clic' moment for him, and he found
            himself diving deeper and deeper into this fascinating world.
            Eventually, he discovered "OpenClassroom," a MOOC website that
            covers a broad range of topics, including programming, networking,
            and more. Starting with the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, he
            quickly progressed to more advanced topics like PHP and eventually
            Java programming. Learning Java was the best decision of his life,
            as he still use it extensively to this day. Additionally, he
            received his first introduction to Linux and networking through
            OpenClassroom. After his time with OpenClassroom, he continued his
            education by studying networking at university. However, during his
            second year, the Covid-19 pandemic hit, which meant he had to adjust
            to learning online. Luckily, he had the opportunity to take the
            "CCNAv7 Introduction to Network" course at the Cisco Networking
            Academy and received a certificate. He also took courses on Linux
            and Python during this time. Once the lockdown was lifted, he
            returned to university and finished my studies. Now, he's eager to
            practice and further develop his skills by finding a job that allows
            him to apply his knowledge of technologies like Ansible, Docker, and
            more. He's passionate about the intersection of networking and
            programming, and he's excited to see where this journey takes him.
