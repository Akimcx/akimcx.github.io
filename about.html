      Hello, my name is Kassim A. Acacia, I am a Network Engineer and developer.
      My passion for technology started when I stumbled upon "Le blog du
      hacker", a website that introduced me to the world of programming and
      networking. It was like a 'd√©clic' moment for me, and I found myself
      diving deeper and deeper into this fascinating field. Eventually, I
      discovered "OpenClassroom," a MOOC website that covers a broad range of
      topics, including programming, networking, and more. Starting with the
      basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I quickly progressed to more advanced
      topics like PHP and eventually Java programming. Learning Java was the
      best decision of my life, as I still use it extensively to this day.
      Additionally, I received my first introduction to Linux and networking
      through OpenClassroom. After my time with OpenClassroom, I continued my
      education by studying networking at university. However, during my second
      year, the Covid-19 pandemic hit, which meant I had to adjust to learning
      online. Luckily, I had the opportunity to take the "CCNAv7 Introduction to
      Network" course at the Cisco Networking Academy and received a
      certificate. I also took courses on Linux and Python during this time.
      Once the lockdown was lifted, I returned to university and finished my
      studies. Now, I am eager to practice and further develop my skills by
      finding a job that allows me to apply my knowledge of technologies like
      Ansible, Docker, and more. I am passionate about the intersection of
      networking and programming, and I am excited to see where this journey
      takes me.
